# Instagram-Followers-Landing-Page
A landing page built for online CPA Marketing purposes, built for a client who requested a site of this particular function.

This site is basically built for CPA Marketing purposes as I said above. Basically what it does is allow the user to type in their Instagram username, the site then uses an API to get JSON data on that account, then displays all the information on the page, after it will have an animation showing it is "adding" 2500 followers to the current number of followers on that account.
Once the above is completed it shows a dialog with a message which links to a CPA Offer.
